# # Regex Tutorial Starter Code

What Is a Regex?
A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input.

For example, the following regular expression can be used to verify that user input is a valid email address:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Each component of this regex has a unique responsibility to make sure that a user enters an email address that begins with an unspecified number of characters preceding the @ symbol, followed by a domain.

Before you get started, watch this introduction to regular expressions videoLinks to an external site. and read Regex Tutorial: Matching a UsernameLinks to an external site. to learn how to identify the different components that make up a regex. If you need any additional help, there are many resources on the web. Feel free to do your own research to find one that can help you complete this assignment.

Once you have a better understanding of what these different parts of a regular expression do, you’ll need to explain what they do for a specific regex.

You can choose one of the following regular expressions or you can choose one that you found on your own (with the exception of the one that is covered in the Regex Tutorial: Matching a UsernameLinks to an external site.:

Matching a Hex Value – /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

Matching an Email – /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Matching a URL – /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

Matching an HTML Tag – /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

Getting Started
Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a gist as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

After you’ve cloned the starter code, learn how to create a gistLinks to an external site.. You can also watch this video on how to use gistsLinks to an external site..

IMPORTANT
Make sure to create a public gist and add the .md file extension to the file name so that your Markdown renders correctly.

The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents. The table of contents should link to sections of the tutorial that describe the functionality of each component in the regex. Be sure to rename the template to a unique name that describes your tutorial.

NOTE
The regular expression that you choose may not include all of the components outlined in the starter code. After you’ve finished your tutorial, you can remove any sections that you didn’t use.

Each section that describes a component should include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It should also include a code snippet of that particular component and some examples that meet the requirements of that component.

IMPORTANT
Make revisions to your gist in the GitHub gist UI. This will create a revision history that graders can use to verify that the tutorial content is yours.
